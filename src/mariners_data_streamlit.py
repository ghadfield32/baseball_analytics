 **Question 1 Project Overview: 
 
 Goal: 1. In the Google Drive folder linked below you will find three files: `data-train.csv`, `data-test.csv`,
and `data-dictionary.csv’.
We have provided the 2023 season of contacted balls for two Minor League levels, along with
play metadata and Trackman hit tracking information, pre-filtered to non-infield plays. This
includes foul balls and home runs not necessarily hit into playable territory. The `train.csv` file
includes two additional columns: on balls caught for outs, `is_airout` will be 1 and `first_fielder`
will give the player id responsible for the out. On balls not caught for outs, `is_airout` will be 0
and `first_fielder` will be null.
Your objective is to predict the air out probability for batted balls in the `data-test.csv` file and
fill out the `p_airout` column in that .csv with your estimate. To assist you, we have included
the ‘data-dictionary.csv’ file to explain what each column in the attached datasets represents.
You may use whatever method or language you like, but you must submit the code you
used to generate and evaluate your predictions. You will be evaluated on both the log loss
score of your predictions and on your process in generating the predictions. Please also
include a brief explanation of your process for an R&amp;D audience and what steps you would
take to improve on this model if you had more resources.

The goal of this project is to predict the probability (p_airout) that a batted ball results in an air out. This involves several steps:

 **Preprocessing and Cleaning**
 **Feature Engineering**
 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
 **Model Selection and Training**
 **Evaluation**
 **Prediction and Analysis**

# Project Summary: Minor Leage Outfielder Prediction of Airouts for the 2023 Season
---

## ** Preprocessing and Cleaning**

### **Handling Missing Values**

- **Spin Rate Filtering**: We noticed that the hit_spin_rate feature had only **1.42%** of its values present. This low percentage suggests that the data is mostly missing, possibly due to technical malfunctions during data collection. Therefore, we decided to drop this feature to prevent it from introducing noise into our model.

  **Why?**

  - Features with excessive missing values can negatively impact model performance.
  - Imputing such a high percentage of missing data might introduce bias.

### **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**

- **Player IDs**: Columns like first_fielder, lf_id, cf_id, and rf_id were dropped. These identifiers are specific to individual players and do not contribute to the generalized prediction of p_airout.

  **Why?**

  - Removing irrelevant or high-cardinality features reduces complexity.
  - Helps prevent overfitting to specific players in the training data.

### **Handling Missing Rows**

- **Dropping Rows with Missing hit_spin_rate**: After dropping the hit_spin_rate column, we ensured that any remaining rows with missing critical values were handled appropriately.

  **Why?**

  - Ensures data integrity for model training.

---

## **3. Feature Engineering**

Feature engineering is crucial to enhance the predictive power of our models. Here's what we did:

### **3.1 Recreating the Ballpark**

- **Average Park Dimensions**: Since we lacked specific venue information for each play, we used the average dimensions of major league parks to create a standardized field.

  **Why?**

  - Provides a consistent basis to evaluate minor league players on a major league scale.
  - Helps in determining whether a hit would be a home run or a foul ball.

- **Simulating the Outfield Boundary**: Using the average distances, we simulated the outfield boundary to classify hits as home runs or in-play.

  **Graphics Included**:

  - **Ballpark Diagram with Hits**: Visualizations showing hit landing points with the outfield boundary.
  - **Home Runs vs. Non-Home Runs**: Separate plots highlighting home runs and catchable balls.

  **Why?**

  - Visual aids help in understanding the spatial distribution of hits.
  - Allows us to filter out uncatchable home runs and focus on plays where the fielder's actions matter.

### **3.2 Estimating Landing Spots**

- **Physics-Based Calculations**: We used the exit speed and angles to estimate the landing spot of the ball.

  - **Adjusted Distance**: Calculated using projectile motion equations, adjusted for spin rate to account for aerodynamic effects.

  **Why?**

  - Provides a more accurate estimation of where the ball would land.
  - Essential for determining if a ball is catchable.

### **3.3 Categorizing Game Context Variables**

- **Count Scenarios**: Combined pre_balls, pre_strikes, pre_outs, and inning into a single feature called count_scenario. This categorizes the game situation into different scenarios.

  **Why?**

  - Simplifies multiple related features into one, making it easier for the model to learn patterns.
  - One-hot encoding of count_scenario allows the model to evaluate deeper on each scenario level.

- **Temperature Categories**: We categorized the temperature into:

  - **Cold**: Below 70°F
  - **Moderate**: 70°F to 90°F
  - **Hot**: Above 90°F

  **Why?**

  - Temperature can affect ball physics and player performance.
  - Categorization helps the model understand the impact without overcomplicating.

### **3.4 Identifying Foul Balls and Catchable Hits**

- **In-Field Foul Balls**: We attempted to identify foul balls that remained in the park and were potentially catchable.

  **Why?**

  - To include plays where fielders have a chance to make an out.
  - Helps in accurately modeling the is_airout outcome.

### **3.5 Defensive Metrics (Post-Prediction Analysis)**

- **Calculating Defensive Stats**:

  - **Reaction Speed**: Estimated based on the distance covered by the fielder and the hang time of the ball.
  - **Distance Covered**: Calculated using the estimated landing spot and assumed starting positions for fielders.
  - **Catch Difficulty**: Categorized as 'Easy', 'Moderate', 'Difficult', or 'Very Difficult' based on hang time and distance.

  **Why?**

  - Provides insights into player performance.
  - **Note**: These metrics were calculated for analysis **after** predictions to avoid data leakage.

- **Cluster Analysis**:

  - Performed clustering on defensive metrics to identify groups of players with similar defensive abilities.

  **Why?**

  - Helps in post-prediction analysis of players.
  - Avoids introducing bias into the predictive model.

---

## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Visualizations**

- **Distribution of Adjusted Distances**: Histograms showing how far balls typically travel.

- **Hit Landing Points**: Scatter plots of landing positions colored by hit direction and whether they resulted in an air out.

- **Temperature Impact**: Analysis of how temperature categories affect hit outcomes.

**Why?**

- EDA helps in understanding the data patterns.
- Identifies potential features that could improve model performance.

---

## **5. Model Selection and Training**

We tested several classifiers:

- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **CatBoost**

### **Why CatBoost Was Chosen**

- **Handling of Categorical Features**: CatBoost natively handles categorical variables without extensive preprocessing.

- **Avoiding Overfitting**: Uses ordered boosting and other regularization techniques.

- **Performance Metrics**: CatBoost outperformed other models in key metrics.

  - **ROC AUC**: 0.9386
  - **Accuracy**: 0.8596
  - **Precision**: 0.8573
  - **Recall**: 0.8632
  - **F1 Score**: 0.8602
  - **Log Loss**: 0.3223

    **Explanation of Log Loss**:

    - Log loss penalizes both overconfident incorrect predictions and underconfident correct predictions.
    - A lower log loss indicates better probability estimates.
    - CatBoost's log loss suggests reliable probabilistic predictions.

**Conclusion**:

- CatBoost's ability to handle our data's specific characteristics made it the optimal choice.
- Its performance in both classification accuracy and probability estimation was superior.

---

## **6. Evaluation**

### **Confusion Matrix**

[[5499  999]
 [ 901 5610]]



- **True Positives (TP)**: 5610
- **True Negatives (TN)**: 5499
- **False Positives (FP)**: 999
- **False Negatives (FN)**: 901

**Interpretation**:

- The model correctly identified a high number of air outs and non-air outs.
- The balance between precision and recall is acceptable for this context.

### **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**

- A high ROC AUC score indicates good discrimination between the two classes.

**Why Evaluation Matters**:

- Ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
- Helps in understanding the trade-offs between different types of errors.

---

## **7. Prediction and Analysis**

### **Making Predictions**

- The model was applied to the test dataset to predict p_airout.
- Predictions were concatenated back to the original test data for further analysis.

**Why?**

- Allows for analysis of predictions in the context of the original features.
- Enables us to study specific scenarios where the model performs well or needs improvement.

### **Interactive Prediction Section**

To provide an interactive experience, we included a section where users can input data points and receive a p_airout prediction.

**Fields Required**:

- **Month**: Numerical value (1-12)
- **Day of Week**: String (e.g., "Monday")
- **Temperature Category**: "Cold", "Moderate", "Hot"
- **Count Scenario**: String combining counts (e.g., "1-2-1-Mid")
- **Hit Direction**: "Left", "Center", "Right"
- **Venue ID**: Numerical value
- **Vertical Exit Angle**: Float
- **Horizontal Exit Angle**: Float
- **Adjusted Distance**: Float
- **Exit Speed**: Float
- **Hit Spin Rate**: Float

**Example**:

json
{
    "month": 6,
    "day_of_week": "Wednesday",
    "temperature_category": "Moderate",
    "count_scenario": "1-2-1-Mid",
    "hit_direction": "Center",
    "venue_id": 10,
    "vert_exit_angle": 35.0,
    "horz_exit_angle": -5.0,
    "adjusted_distance": 300.0,
    "exit_speed": 90.0,
    "hit_spin_rate": 2200.0
}



**Predicted p_airout**:

- The model outputs a probability between 0 and 1.
- In this example, p_airout might be 0.85, indicating an 85% chance of the hit resulting in an air out.


### **Analysis of Predictions**

By analyzing the predictions:

- **Identify Patterns**: See how different features impact the probability.
- **Model Limitations**: Find scenarios where the model might not perform as well.
- **Further Improvements**: Use insights to refine the model or feature engineering steps.

---

## **8. Deployment**

### **Docker Environment**

- **Modularized Setup**: Used Docker and Conda to create a reproducible environment.
- **Automated Workflow**: Wrapped the entire process into a main function for ease of use.

**Why?**

Recent Mistake by the Mariners Organization: Pitching Strategy and Roster Management

One recent mistake by the Mariners organization has been their reluctance to adopt a more flexible pitching strategy to address late-game performance issues. The team’s away record underscores this concern, with several close losses stemming from bullpen struggles. Despite having a strong starting rotation featuring arms like Castillo, Gilbert, and Kirby, the bullpen’s inconsistency in closing out games remains a problem. The Mariners’ save percentage, around league average, indicates that while the talent is there with relievers like Andrés Muñoz, the overall depth and strategic utilization need improvement.

A potential solution could involve adding one or two versatile starters who could serve as a bridge or late-game option. These pitchers would enter games after the primary starter reaches the 4th or 5th inning, taking over to finish or bridge depending on the game’s context. This approach leverages the strengths of an expanded rotation while reducing the exposure of less reliable relievers in high-leverage situations. Using starters in this manner has the dual benefit of keeping opposing lineups off balance and minimizing bullpen fatigue over a long season.

This strategy would require a shift in the Mariners’ pitcher usage philosophy but could significantly improve their ability to secure close games, similar to how the Rays have successfully employed a “bulk” pitcher following a shorter start. It could mitigate late-game collapses, boosting the team’s away record and overall performance.

Moreover, adding a hitter with the profile of a Vinnie Pasquantino—contact-oriented with a high on-base percentage—would stabilize the lineup. While the rotation is impressive, adding versatile pitching and hitting options would better position the Mariners to close games and capitalize on offensive opportunities, reducing late-game issues that have plagued them this season.
